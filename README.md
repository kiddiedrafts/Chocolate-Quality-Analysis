# Chocolate Quality Analysis

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of chocolates to improve their data storage, estimate prices, and ultimately identify high-quality chocolates. The project is divided into three main steps, each addressing a different aspect of chocolate data analysis.

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
In the first step, we explore a dataset of chocolates provided by the vendor. We clean and preprocess the data, ensuring that all necessary information is well-structured for further analysis. This step includes:
- Handling missing or inconsistent data
- Structuring the dataset for efficient analysis

### Step 2: Price Estimation
In the second step, we estimate the prices of chocolates based on the given attributes. We apply statistical methods to predict the cost of each chocolate product, creating a complete dataset with estimated price values for future use.

### Step 3: Identifying Premium Chocolates
In the final step, we focus on identifying high-quality chocolates. By analyzing various features of the chocolates, such as ingredients and ratings, we classify the chocolates produced by companies known for their premium quality. This step aims to distinguish the best products for potential business opportunities.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following key attributes:
- `Company`: The company producing the chocolate
- `Country`: The origin country of the chocolate
- `Rating`: The rating given to each chocolate
- `Ingredients`: The key ingredients used in the chocolate
- `Price`: The estimated price (added in Step 2)
- `Cocoa Percentage`: The percentage of cocoa in the chocolate
